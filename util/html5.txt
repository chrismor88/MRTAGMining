<p class="bodysans1"> BEST NARRATIVE FILM<br />
<span class="mainhead_bi12">Time to Die</span> (<em>Pora Umiera&#263;</em>)
| directed by Dorota&nbsp;K&#281;dzierzawska<br />
Poland, 2007, 104&nbsp;mins<br />
<span class="bodysans_small"><img src="http://2008.wifilmfest.org/img/still_timetodie.jpg" alt="Time to Die" width="150" height="84" border="3" style="float:left; margin-top:3px; margin-right: 5px; border:3px #000000 !important;" /><em>Time
to Die</em> is the story of elderly Aniela, the owner of a once beautiful, now
run-down, wooden villa. After many years, she is finally &ldquo;freed&rdquo; of
the last tenant in that mansion, forced upon her by the Communist government
after World War II. She is once again the master of her own house. But this beautiful,
long-awaited moment is far from what she had hoped. Her only son wants to sell
the house, and there are now noisy neighbors (although they are fun to spy on
with her binoculars). Shut off from the world, Aniela&rsquo;s only companion
is her (quite wonderful) dog, at least until a kid from the youth center start
sneaking through the fence onto her property. Shot in luminous black-and-white
and written especially for the actress Danuta Szaflarska, who was 91 years old
at the time, the film is a &ldquo;stunning visual universe created by K&#281;dzierzawska
and her cinematographer Arthur Reinhart. They are indeed true magicians of the
eye, unafraid to let the camera paint pictures in front of us. This is the special
and particular terrain of this film: the thoughtful depiction of the inner life
of an elderly person. K&#281;dzierzawska and Reinhart&rsquo;s series of stunning
images and the unforgettable dignity of Aniela combine to make <em>Time to Die</em> a
unique film.&rdquo; &mdash; Piers Handling, Toronto International Film Festival.</span></p>

<span class="mainhead_bi12">New Year Baby</span> | directed by Socheata Poeuv<br />
USA, 2007, 75 mins<br />
<em>presented by the UW Asian American Studies Program<br />
</em><span class="bodysans_small"><img src="http://2008.wifilmfest.org/img/still_newyearbaby.jpg" alt="New Year Baby" width="150" height="113" border="3" style="float:left; margin-top:3px; margin-right: 5px; border:3px #000000 !important;" />Born
in a Cambodia refugee camp and raised with her family in Texas, Socheata Poeuv
learns the real story of her parent&rsquo;s survival and of her own heritage:
her sisters are really cousins, adopted after her aunt was killed by the Khmer
Rouge, and her brother is the son of her mother&rsquo;s never-mentioned first
husband. The family returns to Cambodia in a journey that is remarkably engaging,
thanks to Socheata&rsquo;s onscreen appeal and her dedication to allowing her
parents to gradually re-enter that time of their lives that was so harrowing.
A multiple award-winner, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a remarkable story with lump-in-throat
impact.&rdquo; &mdash;<em>Variety</em>.</span></p>
